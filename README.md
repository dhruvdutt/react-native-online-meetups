React Native Online Meetups
===

So I came with this crazy idea about doing online meetups on React Native.

## Upcoming meetups

The second meetup date is yet to be confirmed. Please PR `interestedSpeakers.md` if you'd like to speak. I'd love to hear what you're working on!


## Past Meetups

1. 3-Nov-16 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dek2apWWZA


### How I see it:

1. We get speakers, around 4-5 speakers per meetup.
2. The session will last around for an hour.
3. I mainly would like to see what people are working on, whether it's a library, side project app, or some hack you want to share with others.
4. To be a speaker on a next meetup just send a PR to `interestedSpeakers.md` with your short bio and a very short outline of what you'd like to talk about.
5. Meetups will be live streamed and recorded.
6. More to follow, stay tuned!

### When:

The meetup will be organised whenever we will have enough speakers (4-5), still not sure how much interest this thing will get. Hoping for one every month.

* **Meetup 3rd November 2016**

  Yay! The first meetup happened on 3-Nov-16 at 8pm (GMT). I knew that was not the best time for all of the timezones, but we promise to improve later based on the attendees. The event was **live streamed and recorded.**
